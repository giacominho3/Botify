I'm not like them, but I can pretend
The sun is gone, but I have a light
The day is done, but I'm having fun
I think I'm dumb
Or maybe I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy
My heart is broke, but I have some glue
Help me inhale and mend it with you
We'll float around and hang out on clouds
Then we'll come down
And have a hangover
Have a hangover
Have a hangover
Have a hangover
Skin the sun, fall asleep
Wish away, the soul is cheap
Lesson learned, wish me luck
Soothing burn, wake me up
I'm not like them, but I can pretend
The sun is gone, but I have a light
The day is done, but I'm having fun
I think I'm dumb
Or maybe I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy
