Not far away, the shooter holed up in a hotel
Near to the highway with a friend and the gun, that same gun
He'd fled immediately, but was identified by witnesses
His picture on TV, only 20 years old
They called him "Grandpa"
He was older than the others by a year, maybe two
And he was safe for a while until somebody saw him there
And notified the authorities who surrounded the hotel
First arresting an accomplice while attempting to flee
Then chasing him up the staircase to the floor where he'd stayed
He closed the door hard behind him, locked himself in the room
They could've kicked in the door, but knew the gun was still with him
One he'd already used, and so they feared what he'd do
I floated up through the window of a room to the west
I hovered out to the hallway, tried to listen in
I heard them trying to reason, get him to open the door
His uncle begging and pleading, half-collapsed to the floor
He preached of hope and forgiveness, said, "There is always a chance
To rectify what you've taken, make your peace in the world"
I thought to slip through the door, I could've entered the room
I felt the burden of murder, it shook the earth to the core
Felt like the world was collapsing, then we heard him speak
"Can I still get into heaven if I kill myself?
Can I still get into heaven if I kill myself?
Can I ever be forgiven 'cause I killed that kid?
It was an accident, I swear it wasn't meant for him
And if I turn it on me, if I even it out
Can I still get in or will they send me to hell?
Can I still get into heaven if I kill myself?"
I left the hotel behind, don't wanna know how it ends
