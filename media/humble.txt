Nobody pray for me
It been that day for me
Way
Yeah, yeah!
Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse on 'em with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact, I'm downin' this
D'USSÃ‰ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
I know that it's good, won't you sit it on my taste bluds?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down, we playin' Tetris
A.m. to the 6Cp.m., p.m. to the a.m., funk
Eat up your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know
Tell 'em, be humble (hol' up)
Sit down (hol' up, hol' up, lil', hol' up)
Be humble (hol' up)
Sit down (hol' up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil')
Be humble (hol' up, hol' up)
Sit down (hol' up, hol' up, lil', hol' up)
Be humble (hol' up)
Sit down (hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
