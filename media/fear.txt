Take a minute and think about what you're doing
And why you're doing it, why you pursuing it
Is you really happy?
I been all around the world and back again
I rap it in a microphone and let 'em know that if you're coming at me I'ma never give up
Give a damn if I gotta live up to every single one of your expectations
I remember the moment of my life
The moment of eyesight, all up in the spotlight, uh
Uh, people think we gotta be the perception, what you need is an intervention
Everything that you doin' better be with intention
I hope every single one of you payin' attention, uh (Uh, all my life)
I used to move a certain way because I was afraid
That I would not be loved the way that I deserve to be
Until the day the fear deserted me, deserve to be free
And do whatever the fuck I wanna do when I wanna do it
When it come to the world and creativity (All my life)
I can't let you hold me back, oh no (All my life)
I can't let you hold me back no more
I can't let you hold me back, oh no
I can't let you hold me back no more (Now)
(Yeah)
