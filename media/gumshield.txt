I put my gumshield in
I think I need some help
I put my gumshield in I’m ready
Do I have to body slam everybody in the room to prove my point
‘Cause I will slam everybody in the room to prove my point
Watch out ka-blam
Everybody in the room you listen up
Jean-Claude Van Damme
Everybody in the room you better got the point
This medicine has everyone dancing
You could be on it with me
You can be honest with me
This medicine has everyone dancing
You could be on it with me
You can be honest with me
Guess they'll go and make a new mistake hooray
Then you pick yourself a new crusade
To while away the days
But I just don’t have the energy today
And you just don’t have the empathy
Hooray hooray hooray
Yes I’m angry and I’m disappointed
Yes I’m angry tell me
Do I have to body slam everybody in the room to prove my point
‘Cause I will slam everybody in the room to prove my point
Watch out ka-blam
Everybody in the room you listen up
Jean-Claude Van Damme
Everybody in the room you better got the point
